## âž” Parallel Programming Architecture :

Design and Implementation of different
parallel Network Architectures (Linear Ring, Hypercube) to improve computational
time.

It involved coding such Network Architectures from scratch in C where in
simulation of Merge Sort and DFT algorithm was done using Open Message
Passing Interface (Open MPI) library.
